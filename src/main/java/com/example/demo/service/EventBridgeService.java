import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class EventBridgeService {
    // This service can be used to interact with AWS EventBridge
    // For example, you can publish events to EventBridge or subscribe to events

    // Example method to publish an event
    public void publishEvent(String eventDetail) {
        // Logic to publish an event to AWS EventBridge
        // This could involve using the AWS SDK for Java
        // and configuring the necessary credentials and region
    }

    // Example method to subscribe to events
    public void subscribeToEvents() {
        // Logic to subscribe to events from AWS EventBridge
        // This could involve setting up a listener or handler for incoming events
    }

    public void cancelEvent(String string) {
        // Logic to cancel to events in AWS EventBridge

    }


    // Additional methods can be added as needed to handle specific event types or workflows
    // For example, you might have methods to handle specific event types,
    // process events, or manage event rules and targets in EventBridge
    // You can also inject AWS SDK clients or use Spring Cloud AWS for easier integration
    // with AWS services, including EventBridge.
    // Make sure to handle exceptions and errors appropriately,
    // and consider using asynchronous processing if needed for performance.
    // Note: Ensure that you have the necessary AWS SDK dependencies in your project
    // and that your AWS credentials are configured correctly.
    // You can also use Spring Cloud AWS to simplify the integration with AWS services.
    // For example, you can use @EnableContext to enable AWS context support,
    // and @Autowired to inject AWS clients like AmazonEventBridgeAsyncClient.
    // Additionally, consider using Spring's @Scheduled annotation
    // to periodically check for events or perform background tasks related to EventBridge.
    // You can also use Spring's @EventListener annotation
    // to listen for specific events and trigger actions in your application.
    // Make sure to configure the necessary AWS SDK properties,
    // such as region, credentials, and endpoint, in your application properties or YAML file.
    // You can also use Spring's @ConfigurationProperties
    // to bind AWS SDK properties to a configuration class for better organization.
    // Ensure that you handle any exceptions or errors that may occur
    // during event publishing or subscription,
    // and consider implementing retry logic or error handling strategies
    // to ensure reliability and resilience in your event-driven architecture.
    // You can also implement logging and monitoring for your EventBridge interactions
    // to track event processing and identify any issues that may arise.
    // Consider using AWS CloudWatch for monitoring and logging,
    // and set up appropriate alarms or notifications for critical events or errors.
    // Additionally, you can implement security measures
    // such as IAM roles and policies to control access to EventBridge resources,
    // ensuring that only authorized users or services can publish or subscribe to events.
    // You can also use AWS EventBridge's event bus feature
    // to create custom event buses for different applications or services,
    // allowing for better organization and separation of events.
    // Consider implementing event schemas or contracts
    // to define the structure and format of events,
    // ensuring consistency and compatibility across different services.
    // You can also use AWS EventBridge's schema registry
    // to manage and validate event schemas,
    // allowing for easier integration and evolution of event-driven architectures.
    // You can also implement event filtering and routing
    // to direct events to specific targets or services based on their content or attributes.
    // This can help reduce noise and improve the efficiency of event processing.
    // Additionally, consider implementing event deduplication
    // to prevent duplicate events from being processed,
    // especially in scenarios where events may be retried or replayed.
    // You can also use AWS EventBridge's event archiving feature
    // to store and retrieve past events for auditing or debugging purposes.
    // This can be useful for tracking event history or troubleshooting issues in your application.
    // You can also implement event versioning
    // to manage changes to event schemas or structures over time,
    // allowing for backward compatibility and smooth transitions between different versions of events.
    // Consider using AWS EventBridge's event replay feature
    // to reprocess past events in case of failures or changes in your application logic.
    // This can help ensure that your application can recover from errors
    // and continue processing events without losing any important data.
    // You can also implement event correlation
    // to link related events together, allowing for better tracking and analysis of event flows.
    // This can be useful for understanding complex event interactions
    // and identifying patterns or trends in your event-driven architecture.
    // You can also use AWS EventBridge's event transformation feature
    // to modify or enrich events before they are sent to targets,
    // allowing for better integration with downstream services or applications.
    // This can help ensure that events are in the right format
    // and contain all the necessary information for processing.
    // You can also implement event throttling
    // to control the rate at which events are published or processed,
    // preventing overload or resource exhaustion in your application.
    // This can be useful for managing high volumes of events
    // and ensuring that your application remains responsive and performant.
    // You can also use AWS EventBridge's event archiving and replay features
    // to store and reprocess past events for auditing, debugging, or testing purposes.
    // This can help ensure that your application can recover from errors
    // and continue processing events without losing any important data.
    // You can also implement event monitoring and alerting
    // to track the health and performance of your event-driven architecture,
    // allowing you to quickly identify and respond to issues or anomalies.
    // This can be done using AWS CloudWatch or other monitoring tools,
    // and can help ensure that your application remains reliable and resilient.
    // You can also consider using AWS EventBridge's event bus feature
